# Paperclip Maximizer Genetic Algorithm

Choose the paperclip model you want to die into, when an AIs with wrong priorities come.

A first experiment playing with Genetic Algorithms. A population of random points evolves aiming to distribute as the paperclip chosen. When the accuracy is good enough, the program starts "producing" that pa that paperclip, drawing it on the screen.
